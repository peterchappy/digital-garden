### Procrastination

- When you don't want to do something you brain associates it with an area of pain

- Not long after working on what they don't like, the nueral discomfort disappears.

1. Unhappy Feeling
2. Funnel into something else
3. Temporary Happy Feeling

- Pomodoro technique is helpful in learning to tricking your brain

### Practice makes permanant

- Anyone can learn anything. 

- Math and Science are considered harder because of the abstract nature of the idea

- It's imporant to practice to learn and strengthen the connections through repeated use

- When you're learning you want to study hard, and then take a break. During this time your brains difuse mode helps your brain's understanding

- Without your brain working in difuse mode, you never build those strong connections. So cramming information never helps you long term understand the concept you are learning.

### Introduction to Memory

- *Long term memory* is stuff you already inheritly know. Like a language or how to solve an equation

- *Working memory* is related to when you are trying to solve a problem or understand a concept

- Working Memory uses prefrontal cortex

- Only holds about four chunks of information

- We tend to organize things into chunks so it seems like our working memory is larger than it is.

- Short term memory is an inefficent blackboard

- Long term memory is like a warehouse.

- Different memories are storied in different areas of the brain.

- Moving information from working memory to long term memory takes work. 

- Repeating something new you are trying to learn over the course of multiple days, spaced out, will help you move it to long term memory.
