While being a seminal book in the cyberpunk genre that spawned many tropes such as the metaverse Snowcrash definitely shows it's age in 2021. 

One section that sticks out to me is the overly detailed sex scene between the 15 year old YT and the primary protagonist Raven. This would not fly if it was written today and felt rather out of place.

A lot of the plot loosely follows the protagonists, Hiro Protagonist (I'm not kidding) and YT as they hunt for the source of the mysterious Snow Crash virus that left a friend of Hiro's, D5vid, brain damaged. This leads into an almost Indiana Jones style adventure across the West cost hunting for an ancient Sumarian tablet that was unearthed by the the mysterious villian Bob L Rife.

While this book by today's standards is rather cliche there were some fun ideas. The idea of the united states being turned into a bunch of franchies run by the Mafia and various other people / organizations.

Overall I'm glad I read it, and feel like it's a book that given some edits would make a very good movie today.

3/5 - Enjoyed it. Maybe would not recommend unless they are a hardcore fan of the genre. And even then I'd only recommend it with caveats.
