## Digital Garden

This is my personal wiki where I transcribe and share all the knowledge I have. Inspired by [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) and [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) the idea is use this wiki as a way to form my thoughts on subjects, store knowledge I've gained for the long term, and better organize my life.
