Shopify is an interesting platform to say the least. Having done WordPress development in the past there is an obvious evolution to be seen there. That being said Shopify development is nowhere near as developer friendly and in it's current state is a plugin app store. There is no concept of development enviroments, the closest is previewing a theme. However if you are previewing a new template, you are unable to attach it to a page unless it's on the active theme, and thus unable to test any user interactions.

Shopify is a powerhouse for a reason. Their Zerg rush strategy to empower developers to want to use and make money off the platform is genius, but anything more complex than a simple e-commerce store is difficult to work with.

That being said I think their may be value to their headless expererience. Why re-invent the wheel if the business is primarily a e-commerce solution?
