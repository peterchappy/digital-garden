By default, Hubspot is setup on our marketing site in order scrape all forms and collect the data. In order to get the data to align correctly the following rules, in order, are how HubSpot tries to match fields to contact properties

NOTE: 

`contact property internal name` - machine name
`contact property label` - display name

```
field name with contact property internal name
field label with contact property label
field label with contact property internal name
field name with contact property label
```
